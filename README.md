# SNHU 3D Graphic Design Project

## Overview
This project was developed for my 3D Graphic Design class at Southern New Hampshire University. It utilizes OpenGL and C++ to create an interactive animation where colored circles bounce around the window. 

## Description
Upon initiation, colored circles bounce around the screen, colliding with each other and floating blocks:
- **Circle Interaction:** When two circles collide, they combine to form a larger circle.
- **Block Interaction:** When a circle hits a floating block, the circle bounces off, and the block disappears, reappearing at another position within the window.

## Installation Instructions
To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. **Download the zip folder**: Download the project zip folder to your local machine.
2. **Extract the files**: Use File Explorer (Windows) or a similar tool on other operating systems to extract the files.
3. **Open the project**: Locate the `.sln` file within the extracted files and open it using an IDE that supports C++ and OpenGL, such as Visual Studio.
4. **Run the project**: Compile and run the project in your IDE to see the animation in action.
