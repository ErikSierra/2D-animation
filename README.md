This project was created for my SNHU 3D Graphic Design class in college using OpenGL in the C++ coding language

Description:
When initiated, colored circles will bounce around the window colliding with each other and the floating blocks. When a circle collides with another circle, they combine into a larger circle. If a circle collides with a floating block, the circle will bounce off and the block will disappear and appear in a new position in the window. 

Please open the Solution file to run this effectively in Visual Studio
